# Technical debt

Implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
Unaddressed technical debt increases software entropy, but it is not always a bad thing, and sometimes (e.g. as a proof-of-concept) is required to move projects forward.

## Causes
- Time pressure: Development teams may even shortchange performance and quality to get to market quicker.
- Constant change: Ever-increasing customer expectations, the rise of new market opportunities, new cyber threats, and developer turnover create ongoing challenges for IT leaders.
- Outdated technology: Every Developing coding languages, frameworks and libraries can become obsolete or not supported each year. 
- Insufficient up-front definitions.
- Tightly-coupled components: the software is not flexible enough to adapt to changes in business needs.
- Lack of a test suite.
- Lack of software documentation.
- Parallel development on multiple branches.
- Delayed refactoring. the longer refactoring is delayed, and the more code is added, the bigger the debt.
- Lack of knowledge, when the developer doesn't know how to write elegant code.
- Lack of ownership, when outsourced software efforts result in in-house engineering being required to refactor or rewrite outsourced code.

Martin Fowler classifies technical debt based on intent (deliberate/inadvertent) and context (reckless/prudent).
